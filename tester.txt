Tester Documentation:

Standard tests:
-----------------

1)Register user (user: 'a', pass:'aaaaaa').
2)Login this user.
3-5)Add three todos.
6)Show all todos
7)Mark first todo as complete.
8)Show all todos
9)Delete second todo.
10)Show all remaining todos.
11)delete all todos (-1).
12)Show all todos, expect none.
13)logout.

Wrong requests tests:
----------------------

14)After the logout try to get todos (same as getting todos before logging in).
15)Try to register a user that already exists(account hijacking attack).
16)Try to register with illegal params(password too short <6).
17)Try login with wrong password. 

Worth mentioning:
------------------
1)A logout while NOT logged in will do nothing except for login screen redirection.
2)Register process includes login, i.e. after register you're already logged in and redirected to the todo list.
	This is intentional (a feature) to make usage more fluent and intuitive.
3)Username,password and fullname are size restricted and character restricted.
	Details on the exact restrictions will show-up on the login screen once an illegal input is entered.

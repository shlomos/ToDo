- can your app suffer from XSS? if yes how can you fix it? if not why not?
	-No, all the information posted to the server by the user is converted to
	 string, escaped and never becomes part or evaluated as part of the pages HTML code,
	 hence, an attacker cannot plant malicious code.
	 
- can your app suffer from CSRF? if yes how can you fix it? if not why not?
	-Yes, if an attacker manages to, through another website, make the user send a specially crafted request
	 ,say a POST with a todo or even just 'website.com/logout' it may change the user state.
	 To fix this there are a few possibilities, for example double checking - sending a confirmation request for every
	 operation, OR adding a key(more specifically hashing with the app given key every request). This way an attacker cannot
	 make any operation, as he doesn't have the special key.

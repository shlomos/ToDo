1)middleware static next() instead of 404.
	404 msg commented out and moved to "else if(level >= stack.length){"
	in proto->handler->next definition.
2)http->ServerResponse end() method.
	Added con.end(); if no data not present or null - for intuitivity.
3)Added content-length to miniExpress send (when only status).
	"this.set('content-length',0);" - for better readability by browsers.
4)Added media types support for: .png and .ico
	In http->IncomingMessage - a client isde dependency.
5)success on cookie set in parser removed.
	In http->parser->"success=req.rawCookies.push(reqLine[1]);" - not needed.

General Comments:
-------------------
I must say that at the beginning of the semester I thought that building server side application on top
of JavaScript was a bad idea. Now at a perspective of time, I have never been so wrong. The course made me
dive into a whole new world of Dynamic, Async programming revealing the true beauty and power of Node.JS

Building express; and http module from a scratch was the best way to get fast into business, let alone 
reading and understanding the HTTP RFC.

Angular was a great bonus that was very interesting to get familiar with.

Thank you very much,
